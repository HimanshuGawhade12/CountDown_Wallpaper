# Countdown Wallpaper Generator

This Python script generates a dynamic countdown wallpaper that updates every second, displaying the time remaining until a specified target date. It automatically sets the generated image as the desktop background (Windows only).

## Key Features
- Real-time updates every second.
- Bold, easy-to-read countdown text.
- Customizable target date and font style.
- Automatically sets the wallpaper on Windows systems.

## Requirements

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Pillow Library**: Install Pillow for image editing:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```
3. **Font File**: Place a `.ttf` font file (e.g., `GLECB.TTF`) in the same directory as the script. This is required for rendering the countdown text.

## How to Get Started

### 1. Set Your Target Date
Edit the `target_date` variable in the script with your desired date and time:
```python
from datetime import datetime

# Replace with your target date and time
target_date = datetime(2025, 4, 30, 23, 59, 59)
```

### 2. Run the Script
Execute the script using the following command:
```bash
python countdown.py
```

### 3. Enjoy Your Countdown Wallpaper
The script generates a new wallpaper every second and automatically sets it as your desktop background (on Windows systems).

## Included Files
- `countdown_wallpaper.jpg`: The dynamic wallpaper image generated by the script.
- `GLECB.TTF`: The font file used to render the countdown text. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the script.

## Customization
- **Font Style**: Update the `font_path` variable in the script to use a different `.ttf` font file.
- **Text Style**: Modify text color, size, or position by editing the relevant sections of the script.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Font File
If you encounter a font-related error, check that the `font_path` points to a valid `.ttf` file in the same directory as the script.

### Wallpaper Not Updating
- Verify system permissions.
- Confirm the script is running on a Windows device.

### System Performance
On older or slower systems, continuous wallpaper updates might impact performance.

## Important Notes
- **Font File**: Ensure the font file path is correct. The script will stop with an error if the font cannot be located.
- **Windows Compatibility**: The wallpaper feature uses the Windows `SystemParametersInfoW` API and is not supported on macOS or Linux.
